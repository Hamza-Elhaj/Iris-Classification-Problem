# Iris Classification Problem with Python Scikit-learn
This repository are specialized to applying different machine learning analysis to Iris classification problem.

## Overview
This is a simple classification task performed on Iris dataset - one of the most well-known dataset in the world of data science and machine learning.

## Problem definiton
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.
